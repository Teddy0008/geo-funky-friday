Links: **[GameJolt mod page](https://gamejolt.com/games/OMGITSORANGEBEANIEBOIFROMFNF/644271)**

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and will never be official, so don't get confused.

# Features

 - **New Week**
	 - A new Week with 3 brand new songs!
 - **New Character**
	 - A new Character, Geo!
 - **3 New Songs**
	 - 3 new songs in this mod, including: Mansion, Geoland, Flames!
 - **Dialogue**
	 - This mod adds dialogue for the 3 new songs!
	 - Replays just store information about what you're doing, they don't actually record the screen -- so they take up way less space on your disk than videos.
 - **Cutscenes** (not sure yet)
	 - We **May** add cutscenes to this mod in a future update!
